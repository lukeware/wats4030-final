<h4>Public Domain</h4>
<img src="images/public_domain.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
<p>All works published before 1923 are automatically in the public domain, meaning you can use them however you like. That&rsquo;s why works such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pride_and_Prejudice_and_Zombies">Pride, Prejudice and Zombies</a> exists. Since the original was published in 1813 and thus is long in the public domain, Seth Grahame-Smith was able to interject zombies of his own. Works published after 1923 are a little more complicated. Check out the <a href="http://librarycopyright.net/resources/digitalslider/">Digital Copyright Slider</a> to evaluate individual works.</p>
<h4>Open Educational Resources (OER)</h4>
<img src="images/open_educational_resources.png" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
<p>Open Educational Resources are teaching and learning materials, such as instructional videos, images and even simulations, that you may freely use and reuse at no cost. Unlike heavily restricted copyright protected work ("all rights reserved"), OERs have been created by an individual or organization who choose to retain few, if any, rights.. This done in the spirit of open, accessible education to create a better shared humanity. Below you will find some of the most significant OER distributors. </p>
