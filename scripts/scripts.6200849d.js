Since the original was published in 1813 and thus is long in the public domain, Seth Grahame-Smith was able to interject zombies of his own. Works published after 1923 are a little more complicated.

My job was to learn and navigate the nuances of copyright law so that students and teachers didn\'t have to. A large part of my job was working essentially as an on-campus publishing agency. A faculty member would identify a list of materials they wanted their students to read. From there I would find the correct copyright holder, obtain permission at whatever fee is set by the rightsholder, publish and sell that content to students, and then take that money and send it to the copyright holder as payment. I dealt with a number of different rightsholders including all major publishing companies, music labels, and motion picture agencies. Iâ€™ve also spent a lifetime being a content consumer and producer, trying to figure out how to use and expand on others work and also how to let them use my own. </p> <br> <h4>The Gaping Compulsory Hole</h4> <p>You may not know it, but the United States government actually intervens to make sure copyright fees are not too high. While you may be impressed that the government has intervened to stop big record labels from gouging independent musicians through royalty fees, there is an incredibly large compulsory license hole: education. While U.S. Code has outlined provisions for limited claims of fair use exemptions in education, they have granted no such terms for royalty rates when fair use does not apply. The Beatles owners can\'t gouge you if you want to cover &ldquo;Hey Jude,&rdquo; but don\'t expect the same treatment from Houghton Mifflin Harcourt if you want to copy 20 pages from George Orwell\'s &ldquo;1984&rdquo; and hand it out to your students.</p> <p>According to <a href="http://www.copyright.com/">Copyright Clearance Center</a> (CCC), primary organization that manages the bulk of educational permissions, Houghton charges a rate of 60 cents per page, per student copy. That means to sell students a copy of just 20 out of 328 pages of Orwellâ€™s 1984 it would cost $12.00 per student copy in permissions fees. Thatâ€™s just 6% of the book. Extrapolating, that would mean that to secure permission to copy the entire book in a non-profit educational setting would be $196.80 per copy sold. Currently the book sells for $9.99 at my favorite local bookstore <a href="http://www.thirdplacebooks.com/book/9780451524935">Third Place Books</a> or even cheaper on Amazon. Hmm.</p> <br> <h4>The &copy; Symbol</h4> <p>You see this symbol everywhere today. You\'ll be hard pressed to find a single website without this symbol at the bottom. The last line of visible text written by the newest and oldest content creators around the web is &ldquo;Copyright &copy; 20XX. All rights reserved.&rdquo; When I created my first website in the early 2000s, I remember typing those words and that symbol at the bottom of my homepage. Still a teenager, I felt like I was adding legitimacy to my words. I had created something and I was leaving my mark to the world that I owned every part of what they had seen. At the time, I knew nothing about what the symbol meant. In fact, I was worried that I was potentially violating some sort of law since I hadn\'t actually registered my work with anyone. &nbsp;</p> <br> <h4>No Symbol Needed</h4> <p>Contrary to popular belief, you don\'t need a copyright mark to tell the world that your work is fully protected by copyright law. When something is published in the United States it\'s automatically protected by<a href="http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title17&amp;edition=prelim"> United States Code 17 - Copyrights</a>. You are actually able to omit any mention of copyright but still be fully protected. Why? Any work you create is automatically protected from the moment of creation. You actually don\'t need to get the government involved at all unless you intend to sue someone in court. The registration of copyright essentially brings your work into the jurisdiction of the courts and is essentially like filing for a <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/docs/fees.html">$35 permit</a>. Curious how complicated copyright law is in the U.S.? Well, USC 17 contains approximately 214,589 words. That\'s more words than Melville wrote for Moby Dick.</p> <br> <h4>The Compulsory Licenses</h4> <p>Something copyright law has weighed many times through many revisions is the balance between protecting our rights to our own work and protecting the need for continued creativity. The desire to both protect and grow has resulted in a set of compulsory licenses that cover things like music royalties, <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/118">public broadcasting</a>, <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#111">cable retransmissions</a>,</p> <p>If you\'re a small indie band recording in your garage and performing in the back of local music stores, you may not be aware of an incredibly powerful provision in copyright law that grants you some interesting rights. You may also not be aware that, when you release your own music publicly, you\'re giving up some of your own rights too. <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#115">USC 17 Chapter 1, 115</a> states that when any musician releases a song in the U.S. they are required to allow anyone else to record their own cover of that song for a universal set fee.</p> <br> <h4>A Beautiful Shared Music</h4> <p>Do you want to tap into the immensely popular &ldquo;It\'s a Small World (Afterall)&rdquo; by Disney\'s The Sherman Brothers? Perhaps you want to cover The Beatles&rdquo; Hey Jude&rdquo; or even a lesser known song like &ldquo;The Old Revolution&rdquo; by Leonard Cohen. Well, you absolutely can. Thanks to the mandatory compulsory license for musicians, you can head over to the Harry Fox Agency\'s (HSA) <a href="http://www.songfile.com">Songfile</a> and secure the right to release that song on your own album, internet download, or streaming service. You just need to know the final track length and how many albums you\'re going to release. &ldquo;Hey Jude&rdquo; can be found with code H42000, and Cohen\'s &lsquo;Revolution\' can be found with code T54689. Rates differ based on distribution method, but if you\'re releasing a CD or vinyl for example, the rate is 9.1 cents per song per album. That means if you release 100 copies of an album with a cover of &ldquo;The Old Revolution&rdquo; by Cohen, you\'re required to send $9.10 to HSA. They are going to send that money to Sony Music, and Sony is going to send a portion to Cohen\'s estate.</p> <p>The rate is exactly the same for The Beatles or anyone else. 9.1 cents. If you release a song, your work is obligated to the same terms. If someone wants to cover your song, they owe you the same rate. You\'re allowed to charge them less, or no fee, but you can\'t charge them more. Why? The rates are set by three Copyright Royalty Judges appointed by the Librarian of Congress with the intention to &ldquo;maximize the availability of creative works to the public."</p> <br> <h4>Copyright Royalty Judges</h4> <br> <p>Rates are set by 3 full-time Copyright Royalty Judges appointed by the Librarian of Congress</p> </div> </div>')}]);
