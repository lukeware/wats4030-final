Why does this site exist? 

  

I created this project because I spent seven years navigating the muck of the copyright world on behalf of educators. 

  

The © Symbol

  

You see this symbol everywhere today. You’ll be hard pressed to find a single website without this symbol at the bottom. The last line of visible text written by amatuer and elite developers around the world is “Copyright © 20XX. All rights reserved.” Often when reading those words I wonder how much or how little those sites actually know about their meaning. That, in part, is why I’ve created this project.  

  

No Symbol Needed

  

Contrary to popular belief, you don’t need a copyright mark to tell the world that your work is fully protected by copyright law. When something is published in the United States it's automatically protected by[United States Code 17 - Copyrights](http://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title17&edition=prelim). You are actually able to omit any mention of copyright but still be fully protected. Why? Any work you create is automatically protected from the moment of creation. You actually don’t need to get the government involved at all unless you intend to sue someone in court. The registration of copyright essentially brings your work into the jurisdiction of the courts and is essentially like filing for a [$35 permit](https://www.copyright.gov/docs/fees.html). Curious how complicated copyright law is in the U.S.? Well, USC 17 contains approximately 214,589 words. That's more words than Melville wrote for Moby Dick. 

  

My job was to learn and navigate the nuances of copyright so that teachers didn't have to. I would do the work of identifying the correct copyright holder, obtain permission at whatever rate is set by the owner, publish and sell that content to students, and then take that money and send it to the copyright holder. 

  

One of the most disturbing things I discovered about copyright in the United States 

  

The Compulsory Licenses 

  

Something copyright law has weighed many times through many revisions is the balance between protecting our rights to our own work and protecting the need for continued creativity. The desire to both protect and grow has resulted in a set of compulsory licenses that cover things like music royalties, [public broadcasting](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/118), [cable retransmissions](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#111), 

  

If you’re a small indie band recording in your garage and performing in the back of local music stores, you may not be aware of an incredibly powerful provision in copyright law that grants you some interesting rights. You may also not be aware that, when you release your own music publicly, you’re giving up some of your own rights too. [USC 17 Chapter 1, 115](https://www.copyright.gov/title17/92chap1.html#115) states that when any musician releases a song in the U.S. they are required to allow anyone else to record their own cover of that song for a universal set fee. 

  

A Beautiful Shared Music

  

Do you want to tap into the immensely popular “It’s a Small World (Afterall)” by Disney’s The Sherman Brothers? Perhaps you want to cover The Beatles” Hey Jude” or even a lesser known song like “The Old Revolution” by Leonard Cohen. Well, you absolutely can. Thanks to the mandatory compulsory license for musicians, you can head over to the Harry Fox Agency’s (HSA) [Songfile](http://www.songfile.com) and secure the right to release that song on your own album, internet download, or streaming service. You just need to know the final track length and how many albums you’re going to release. “Hey Jude” can be found with code H42000, and Cohen’s ‘Revolution’ can be found with code T54689. Rates differ based on distribution method, but if you’re releasing a CD or vinyl for example, the rate is 9.1 cents per song per album. That means if you release 100 copies of an album with a cover of “The Old Revolution” by Cohen, you’re required to send $9.10 to HSA. They are going to send that money to Sony Music, and Sony is going to send a portion to Cohen’s estate.

  
The rate is exactly the same for The Beatles or anyone else. 9.1 cents. If you release a song, your work is obligated to the same terms. If someone wants to cover your song, they owe you the same rate. You’re allowed to charge them less, or no fee, but you can’t charge them more. Why? The rates are set by three Copyright Royalty Judges appointed by the Librarian of Congress with the intention to “maximize the availability of creative works to the public."
